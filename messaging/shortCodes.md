Yes. We support most US and Canadian short codes. We do not support sending to premium short codes.

If you'd like to know if we support a specific short code, please [contact Bandwidth support](https://support.bandwidth.com/hc/en-us/restricted?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.bandwidth.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Frequests%2Fnew). For a complete list of short codes, you can visit the [U.S. Short Codes Directory](https://usshortcodedirectory.com/directory).
