If you do not want to receive any phone calls for a list of phone numbers assigned to an application, you must remove the [incomingCallUrl](http://dev.bandwidth.com/ap-docs/methods/applications/postApplicationsApplicationId.html#) property and set the [autoAnswer](http://dev.bandwidth.com/ap-docs/methods/applications/postApplicationsApplicationId.html#) property to ‘false’ for your application associated with that phone number.

You can also [remove the phone number from an application](http://dev.bandwidth.com/ap-docs/methods/phoneNumbers/postPhoneNumbersNumberId.html)
